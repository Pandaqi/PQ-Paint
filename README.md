My very rudimentary painting widget, used in my visual/design tutorials (most notably [Drawing](https://pandaqi.com/tutorials/visual/drawing/)).

It provides several tools:

* Drawing (Pen or Soft Brush)
* Erase
* Color Picker
* Fill Tool

Of course, you can freely modify brush properties

* Opacity
* Color
* Hardness
* Size

General functionality:

* Clear canvas
* Download canvas as an image
* Undo (up to a limit, as it saves the _whole_ canvas state in history)

It does what it's supposed to do. The code is quite clean, fast and bug-free. 

That being said, it doesn't do much more and the current state is more of a "first attempt". The todo file contains extra functionality or approaches for the future. (Especially soft brushes have become the bane of my existence.)
